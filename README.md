## Effective Face Frontalization in Unconstrained Images Source Code for Python 3

* This is a Python port of the Face Frontalization code provided by Hassner *et al.* at http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/projects/frontalize
* Python port of the frontalization project is done by Douglas Souza.
* Original Python port is only compatible with Python 2.
* This is the Python 3 compatible version I modified for my own personal research.
* This version comes with pre-downloaded Dlib models.
